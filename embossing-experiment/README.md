# Embossing thin aluminum using a 3D-printed die

## Goal
I'd like to establish a process to take the aluminum from aluminum cans and emboss shapes into them using a 3D printed die designed in Autocad Fusion 360.

## Challenges
The chamfer tool I wanted to use has limitations. The 'loft' tool can be used to produce a suitable outcome.
