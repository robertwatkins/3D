# Embossing thin aluminum using a 3D-printed die

## Goal
I'd like to establish a process to take the aluminum from aluminum cans and emboss shapes into them using a 3D printed die designed in Autocad Fusion 360.

## Challenges
The chamfer tool I wanted to use has limitations. The 'loft' tool can be used to produce a suitable outcome.

## Materials
I'm using a 'standard' 123mm x 66mm soda can.

Then I remove the top and bottom (using [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3658526)) and end up with a roughly 90mm x 235mm x 0.15 mm sheet of metal.
NOTE:The actual thickness of the walls of cans varies between 0.1mm and 0.2mm. I'm assuming a 0.15mm wall thickness.

## Starting Point
I created a 'blank' die that has a 75mm x 75mm x 0.165mm blank set in the base to allow for a 75mm square of aluminum. The depth is my assumed 0.15 mm + a 10% variance. The 10% comes from someone on the internet, which must make it true.
