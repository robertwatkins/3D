I'd like to add chamfers like this:
![Chamfer Experiment](ChamferExperiment.jpeg)
[Chamfer Experiment Fusion File](ChamferExperiment.f3d)

Using this file:
![Initials Experiement](InitialsExperiemnt.jpeg)
[Initials Experiment Fusion File](Experiment Initials-Revisited.f3d)

The trouble is that I get an error:
```
Error:
The fillet/chamfer could not be created at the requested size. This might be occurring at the ends of the selected edges.
Try adjusting the size or using multiple separate operations. Check that the selected edge chain ends at a sensible position, and if not try selecting more edges.
```

I've messed around with :
* Creating an offset face
* Removing and repairing faces
* Generally futzing around with stuff

But I'm not getting anywhere
